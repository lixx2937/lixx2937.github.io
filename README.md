# HOMEPAGE #

The homepage ripository contains the source code and pictures that I used for my homepage. 

This is a homepage that I created to showcase my skills/projects/experiences. 

It is also my first homepage so there are probably some things I need to improve on.

If you see anything wrong that catches your eye, I would love to hear feed back on what you think I need to change.
