# HOMEPAGE #

The homepage ripository contains the source code and pictures that I used for my homepage. 

This is a homepage that I created to showcase my skills/projects/experiences. 

It is also my first homepage so there are probably some things I need to improve on.

If you see anything wrong that catches your eye, I would love to hear feed back on what you think I need to change.

# REGISTRATION FORM #

The registration form ripository contains a small project I did.

I created a web form that saves the information that you input into a database, hosted on freemysqlhosting.net. 

The form posts the information to a databasehandler.php file hosted on 000webhost.com. 

I have made a copy of the php file on here so you can see the code. 

Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.
