Hello,

Thank you for visiting my github.

I have created a web form that saves the information that you input into a database, hosted on freemysqlhosting.net.

The form posts the information to a databasehandler.php file hosted on 000webhost.com.
I have made a copy of the php file on here so you can see the code.

Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

Thanks!
Andy
